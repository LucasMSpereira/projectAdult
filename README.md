# projectAdult
Machine learning project on the adult/census income dataset

Project about data preparation, and machine learning model building and testing. Hyperparameter search done by grid search with cross-validation.

Classifiers tested: k nearest neighbors, decision tree, gradient boosted tree, support vector machines, and multi-layer perceptron.

This was part of the evaluation in the discipline "Statistical learning" during my master's degree.
